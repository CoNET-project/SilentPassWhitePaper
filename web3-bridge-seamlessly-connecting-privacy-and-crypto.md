### 1️⃣ The Web3 Adoption Problem: Complexity & Barriers to Entry

While Web3 promises decentralization and financial freedom, the onboarding process is often complicated:

❌ Manual Wallet Setup: Users must create an external wallet, store their private keys, and understand complex seed phrases.

❌ Blockchain Confusion: Crypto operates across multiple networks (Ethereum, Solana, etc.), making it difficult for users to manage multiple wallets.

❌ Limited Web3 Integration in VPNs: Most VPNs do not support crypto natively, making anonymous crypto payments inconvenient.

❌ Security Risks: Many new users fail to back up private keys, leading to fund loss if wallets are lost or compromised.



💡 Silent Pass is making Web3 adoption easier, smoother, and more user-friendly—all while keeping privacy at the core.
