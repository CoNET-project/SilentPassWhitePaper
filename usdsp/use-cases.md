# Use Cases

### Subscription Payments, Rewards, & Governance

$SP is not just a tokenâ€”it is the economic foundation of Silent Pass. Every user interaction within the network strengthens the ecosystem, making $SP an essential component of Silent Passâ€™s long-term success.

ðŸ”¹ Use Case #1: Subscription Payments

Traditional VPNs require fiat paymentsâ€”which means exposing credit card details, personal information, and banking data. This is a major privacy risk for users who need anonymity the most.

âœ” Silent Pass eliminates this issue by allowing users to pay for VPN & Proxy services with $SP.

âœ” No credit cards, no centralized payment processorsâ€”just pure, anonymous transactions.

âœ” Seamless integration with CoNET Chain and Solana for decentralized payments.

\
ðŸ’¡ Example: A Silent Pass user in a censorship-heavy country needs complete privacy. They donâ€™t want to reveal their identity by paying with a traditional bank account. By using $SP, they purchase a Silent Pass subscription completely anonymously, avoiding government tracking.

ðŸ”¹ Use Case #2: Governance & Community Voting

Silent Pass operates as a decentralized, community-driven network. Instead of decisions being made by a central company, $SP holders can vote on future upgrades and ecosystem developments.

âœ” Decentralized governance ensures no single entity controls Silent Pass.

âœ” Users propose and vote on network improvements.

âœ” True Web3 principlesâ€”where privacy advocates shape the future of online security.

\
ðŸ’¡ Example: Silent Pass users vote on whether to integrate new privacy-enhancing features into the network. $SP holders participate in governance proposals, ensuring that the community directs the projectâ€™s future.
