# Zero-Trust : Assumes no entity inside or outside a network can be trusted by default

## The Problem: Traditional VPNs Require Trust

\
Most VPN providers require users to trust them with sensitive data. Even when they claim to have zero-logs, there is no way to verify it.

🚨 Issues with Traditional VPN Trust Models:

❌ A trusting based on a promise.

❌ VPN providers could be lying about logs.

❌ Data breaches at centralized servers expose user identities.

❌ Governments can subpoena VPNs for user information.



### The Silent Pass Solution: Zero-Trust, Fully Decentralized Model

Never Trust

🔹 How It Works:

✔ Anonymous: A wallet address used to communication address which can be generated and discarded at any time.

✔ Zero Metadata Network Protocol: Ciphertext without recipient and sender.

✔ Open Source Code: Undergo peer safety review.

✔ Fragmentation: All pieces of puzzle has same shape. Only the user holds the key can splice to complete the puzzle.

✔ Decentralized Infrastructure: Relay nodes not under central control.

💡 Example: If a government orders a traditional VPN provider to hand over logs, it can comply. With Silent Pass, no such logs exist—because no single entity controls the network.
