# Wallet-Based Authentication: Eliminating IP Tracking

## The Problem: Your IP Address is a Digital Fingerprint



Every time you connect to the internet, you expose your IP address—a unique identifier that reveals your physical location, browsing habits, and connection details. Traditional VPNs claim to “hide” your IP, but they simply replace it with a new one assigned by their centralized servers. This means:

❌ VPN Providers Can See & Log Your IP – Many keep records, even if they claim not to.

❌ Governments Can Subpoena VPNs – VPN providers can be forced to hand over user data.

❌ Websites Can Track You – Even with a VPN, services detect patterns in your connections.



### The Silent Pass Solution: Wallet-Based Authentication

Silent Pass eliminates IP tracking entirely by replacing IP-based routing with wallet address authentication. Instead of connecting with an IP, users connect with a wallet address, ensuring complete anonymity.



#### 🔹 How It Works:

✔ Users authenticate with a blockchain wallet address, not an IP.

✔ All network traffic is routed based on wallet addresses, eliminating the need for IP tracking.

✔ No centralized authority issues these addresses, meaning tracking users becomes impossible.



💡 Example: When Alice connects to Silent Pass, her connection is not assigned an IP like traditional VPNs. Instead, a temporary, encrypted session key linked to her wallet address ensures she can access the network securely and anonymously.
