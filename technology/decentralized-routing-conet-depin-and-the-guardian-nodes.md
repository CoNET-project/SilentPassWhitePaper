# Decentralized Routing: CoNET DePIN and The Guardian Nodes

## The Problem: VPNs Are Still Centralized Services

\
Traditional VPNs rely on centralized infrastructure, meaning that if the VPN provider is compromised, acquired, or shut down, all users lose access.

### &#x20;The Silent Pass Solution: A Fully Decentralized Network

\
Silent Pass relies on CoNET DePIN and Guardian Nodes, which are distributed globally and ensure that the network remains fast, secure, and censorship-resistant.

ðŸ”¹ How It Works:

âœ” 20,000+ Guardian Supernodes form the backbone of the network.

âœ” Multiple routing paths available to ensure high-speed connections.

âœ” No centralized control â€“ All network participants maintain privacy.

\
ðŸ’¡ Example: Instead of one company managing all servers, Silent Pass operates like a decentralized blockchain, where multiple nodes voluntarily maintain the network.



ðŸš€ The result? A VPN that cannot be shut down, censored, or compromised.
