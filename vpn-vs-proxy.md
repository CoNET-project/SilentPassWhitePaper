# VPN vs Proxy

### Choosing the Right Privacy Solution 

Not all privacy needs are the same. Some users require full-device protection, while others only need selective privacy for specific apps. Silent Pass provides two distinct solutions to fit different use cases:



1Ô∏è‚É£ Silent Pass VPN ‚Äì A complete privacy shield that encrypts all internet traffic on your device.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Silent Pass Proxy ‚Äì A lightweight, app-specific solution for users who need selective privacy.



This section explains how both work, their key differences, and when to use each option.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Silent Pass VPN: Full-Device Protection

#### The Problem: Your Entire Device is Exposed Online

Every time you connect to the internet, your device exposes:

‚ùå Your IP address ‚Äì Revealing your location and online activity.

‚ùå Your entire browsing & app traffic ‚Äì Everything you do online can be monitored or intercepted.

‚ùå Metadata & connection history ‚Äì Even if content is encrypted, your activity can still be analyzed.



#### The Silent Pass VPN Solution: Encrypting Everything

Silent Pass VPN ensures your entire device is protected‚Äînot just your browser, but all apps, services, and connections.

üîπ How It Works:

‚úî Encrypts all outgoing and incoming traffic, making it unreadable to ISPs and hackers.

‚úî Routes traffic through a decentralized network, preventing tracking.

‚úî Applies multi-hop encryption, ensuring no single point of failure.

‚úî Works automatically‚Äîjust turn it on, and all device traffic is protected.



‚úî Best For:

‚úÖ Users who need complete, all-in-one protection.

‚úÖ People in high-risk environments (journalists, activists, whistleblowers).

‚úÖ Those who want set-it-and-forget-it privacy on all devices.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Silent Pass Proxy: App-Specific Privacy (Browser & Apps)

#### The Problem: Not Every App Needs VPN Protection

Some users don‚Äôt need to encrypt all their traffic‚Äîonly specific apps or services.

‚ùå VPNs can slow down connections for gaming, streaming, or non-sensitive browsing.

‚ùå Users may want privacy only for crypto transactions or DeFi trading.

‚ùå Switching VPNs on/off can be frustrating if only certain apps need protection.

#### &#x20;The Silent Pass Proxy Solution: App-Specific Privacy

Silent Pass Proxy allows users to customize which applications use encrypted routing, leaving other traffic untouched.

üîπ How It Works:

‚úî Allows selected apps (e.g., Chrome, DeFi wallets) to use Silent Pass encryption.

‚úî Does not interfere with apps that don‚Äôt require privacy (e.g., gaming, streaming, downloads).

‚úî Lightweight and fast‚Äîno need to tunnel your entire device through VPN servers.

‚úî Runs in the background with minimal resource usage.



‚úî Best For:

‚úÖ Users who only need privacy for specific apps (e.g., browsers, DeFi wallets, messaging apps).

‚úÖ People who want faster connections for streaming, gaming, and general use.

‚úÖ Web3 users needing privacy-focused transactions without full VPN coverage.
